## Create a cool little application that does one simple thing-- it shows arrow vectors in a pretty 3D rendered graphic that is interactive by dragging the 3D space. 

## Also add sliders in the UI for manipulating the ventor dimensions like:
- total vectors in the space
- magnitude 
- direction
- components
- color change for arrows
- vector entropy
